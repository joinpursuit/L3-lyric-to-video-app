# AI-Powered Lyric & Music Video Generator

## Learning Journey

### **Project Overview**
In this project, you will build an AI system that generates song lyrics with sentiment control and then creates a music video based on those lyrics. This project introduces key AI concepts, including natural language processing (NLP), multimodal AI, and AI-generated video synthesis.

### **Learning Goals**
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand **text generation models** (e.g., GPT) and fine-tune them for **lyric generation**.
- Learn about **sentiment control** in NLP models to guide lyrical mood.
- Explore **text-to-image** models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for generating visuals.
- Integrate **text-to-video** tools (e.g., RunwayML, Pika Labs) to animate generated visuals.
- Work with **multimodal AI**, combining **text, image, and video generation**.
- Use **basic video editing and automation** (e.g., OpenCV, ffmpeg) to compile the final output.

## **Phase 1: Lyric Generation with Sentiment Control**
### **Objective**
Develop an AI-powered lyric generator that produces lyrics based on user-selected sentiment (e.g., happy, sad, dreamy, energetic).

### **Steps**
1. Fine-tune or prompt-engineer a **GPT-based model** (e.g., OpenAI GPT, LLaMA) for lyric generation.
2. Implement sentiment control using a classification-based approach or retrieval-augmented prompts.
3. Generate structured lyrics (verses, chorus) and allow user customization.

### **Key Concepts**
- **NLP & Text Generation** – Using transformer-based models to generate text.
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Controlling AI-generated output to align with mood.
- **Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering** – Choosing the best approach for text control.

## **Phase 2: Music Video Generation**
### **Objective**
Convert AI-generated lyrics into a music video by generating visuals and stitching them into an animated sequence.

### **Steps**
1. Convert each lyric line or verse into AI-generated **images** (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney-style models).
2. Experiment with **text-to-video** tools (RunwayML, Pika Labs) to animate visuals.
3. Use **ffmpeg/OpenCV** to combine images/videos into a structured sequence.
4. Sync visuals with AI-generated text-to-speech vocals or a background track.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Multimodal AI** – Combining different AI models for text, image, and video generation.
- **Generative Image Models** – Creating visuals using AI-driven text-to-image tools.
- **AI-Powered Video Generation** – Automating the process of compiling images into a video.

---

## **Deliverables & Final Presentation**
- **AI-generated lyrics** with user-defined sentiment.
- **Music video** automatically created from generated visuals.
- (Optional) AI-generated **vocals** or **background music**.
- A presentation explaining your **model choices and workflow**.

---

## **Extensions & Future Enhancements**
- Integrate **melody generation** (e.g., MuseNet, Magenta).
- Enhance video with **real-time AI animations**.
- Implement **user feedback loops** to improve lyric & video quality.

---

### **Tech Stack & Tools**
- **NLP Model:** GPT (OpenAI API, Hugging Face, LLaMA)
- **Text-to-Image:** Stable Diffusion, Midjourney API
- **Text-to-Video:** RunwayML, Pika Labs
- **Video Editing:** OpenCV, ffmpeg
- **(Optional) AI Voice:** Coqui TTS, ElevenLabs

## **How to Get Started**
### **Backend Setup (Express.js Example)**
1. Create a new project directory and initialize it:
   ```sh
   mkdir ai-music-video && cd ai-music-video
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install express dotenv axios cors
   ```
3. Create an `index.js` file and set up a simple Express server:
   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json());
   
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('AI Music Video API');
   });
   
   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
   ```
4. **Next Steps:**
   - Integrate OpenAI's GPT API to handle lyric generation based on user input.
   - Create an endpoint that takes user-defined sentiment and returns generated lyrics.
   - Set up API calls to generate text-to-image and text-to-video outputs.

### **Frontend Setup (React Example)**
1. Create a new React app:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app ai-music-video-frontend
   cd ai-music-video-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install axios react-router-dom
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. **Next Steps:**
   - Create a form component where users can enter keywords or choose a sentiment.
   - Connect to the backend API to retrieve AI-generated lyrics.
   - Implement a video display component that renders the AI-generated visuals.
